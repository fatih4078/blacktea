      <p> <strong>Aimer (エメ, Eme)</strong> is a Japanese pop singer and lyricist signed to SME Records and managed by FOURseam. Her name comes from the verb "Aimer" in French, which means "to love".</p>
      <br>
      <p>Her father was the bassist of a band, so Aimer grew up surrounded by music from a very young age. She began studying the piano in elementary school and highly looked up to Ringo Sheena and Utada Hikaru. In junior high school, listening to
        Avril Lavigne inspired her to take up guitar and began writing English lyrics. At the age of 15, Aimer lost her voice due to over-usage of her vocal cords and was forced to undergo silence therapy for treatment. However, that did not stop
        her, and after she recovered, she acquired her distinctive husky voice.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Aimer teamed up with the "Agehasprings" group, which has worked with, produced, or provided music for various artists, including Yuki, Mika Nakashima, Flumpool, Superfly, Yuzu, and Genki Rockets. In 2011, her musical career began in
        earnest. In May 2011, they released the concept album Your favorite things. It covered numerous popular works, including works in various genre such as jazz and country western music. The number 1 record cover was based on Lady Gaga's "Poker
        Face", and was the first song to appear in the lead album chart for the jazz category in the iTunes Store. The album reached number 2.</p>
      <br>
      <p>On September 7, 2011, Aimer debuted for Defstar Records, with the song "Rokutousei no Yoru", which was selected by Fuji TV as the ending theme of the 2011 anime series No. 6. "Rokutousei no Yoru" recorded its highest ranking at number 9
        on
        the Recochoku music distribution chart. The second single was released on December 14, 2011. "Re:pray/ Sabishikute Nemurenai Yoru wa" reached number 1 in the Mora music download charts site. The song "Re: pray" was chosen as the 29th
        ending theme for the anime Bleach. The single includes a cover of Lady Gaga's "Poker Face". The song was previously featured in Aimer's Your Favorite Things, a cover album that was released during her indie era.
